## Use cases

Two software programs have been created that use this library.

+ For Grasshopper in Rhinoceros
    + [HoaryFox](https://github.com/hrntsm/HoaryFox)
    
+ Applications for Windows made with Unity
    + [STEVIA](https://github.com/hrntsm/STEVIA-Stb2U)

## What is ST-Bridge

Quote from [building SMART Japan Structural Design Subcommittee](https://en.building-smart.or.jp/meeting/buildall/structural-design/) doing making specifications of ST-Bridge.

> ST Bridge is the standardized format for data sharing in Japan’s structural engineering industry.
>   + Simpler to use than IFC due to the clearly defined the range of use
>   + Integrate Japanese original methods of drawing methodology (Grids, part placement and section annotations, reinforcement information)
>   + Aim for coordination between domestic structural applications, building skeleton surveying applications, 3D Object CAD
